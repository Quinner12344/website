Introduction
•Hi there and welcome to my digital portfolio. My name is Sean Quinn and I am attending university in TUS Athlone. The course I am studying is Software Design with VR and Gaming. In this portfolio I will go through all my academic achievements and personal achievements, my skills and my experiences. I hope you enjoy this portfolio and look forward to your feedback.

My Skills
•The first thing I will talk about is the skills I have managed to learn in my life. The biggest skill I have learned so far in my life is my ability to make code and make games. This has been achieved with my college course and I have a level 7 degree to show for it and soon to be a level 8 degree. Coding is the future of the world so I feel that this will be a very handy skill to have in the future for future job opportunities. The gaming skill is more of a personal hobby that I have learned since I was a child. I started gaming in 2007 when I was 5 years old. It is my oldest hobby and without gaming as a hobby I wouldn’t have pursued the course I am currently studying in college. It is a major reason for the coding skill I have gained as I want to make games for a future career.


Achievements
•Next up we will talk about my achievements and what I have learned over the last few years in college. In first year I made a calculator app using C++ which was actually a pretty hard project to achieve for a first year student. In second year I made a 2D platformer game. This game contained levels with puzzles and you had to solve them in order to beat the game. My first ever game so it was very basic but it was progress and I was happy with it. 3rd year was the year of my work placement. Mine took place in the college itself as I unfortunately didn’t manage to find a company who would take me in. However I managed to make a good project, which ended up being a database which ended up working out well.

Experiences
•Finally I will mention my experiences in college, the good and the bad. The good experiences have been the projects I have managed to make during my course, my degree and of course the learning I have managed to accomplish over the last few years. However, with everything in life there are also the bad. In first year we had to do all of our classes on zoom because of COVID. This wasn’t ideal as it was my first year of trying to learn a new skill so not having that in class attention made it 10 times harder to learn. In 2nd year I was absent for a few weeks so I ended up being distracted by that for weeks and it stunted my progress again, but I never gave up. And in 3rd year everything was fine apart from the fact I failed 2 modules and had to end up repeating them which meant I had to repeat 3rd year again. I managed to accomplish that last year and now I am in 4th year and so far so good and hopefully it stays that way.

Conclusion
•In conclusion my college experience has been tough for sure but its definitely had its good moments too. I have had to work very hard to earn this degree and there was times I thought I wouldn’t manage to achieve it. However I have enjoyed myself and I would say that it was worth it going to university and it wasn’t a waste of my time which was a concern I had going into university.

Outro
•Thank you for listening to my portfolio, I hope you enjoyed it and I hope that I can add even more to this in the future with even more achievements.
